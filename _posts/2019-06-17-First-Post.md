title: Women as Entertainers?
---

Throughout the articles, we can see how there are different categories based on the content and what is being discussed. Using open refine, and breaking it down into categories, entertain was a common one. Interestingly, almost all of the articles with this as the category, were discussing women in terms of relationships. We can see how this really reveals context about the time period and what was considered entertainment. We also can get an idea of the connotation which was attached to women. 

Many people know that women were often sexualized, and still can be in today's society. However, by analyzing these articles under this category we can understand the community and the way that women were portrayed in newspapers for the wider society to grasp. It is interesting that females and love and relationships are always discussed in unison. It really demonstrates the way in which society felt that genders were practiced, and the different actions and abilites that were associated with females. In much of the same way that women were meant to be in the private sphere, in nurturing roles as mothers, they were also, from a young age taught that part of their role was being a good wife to her husband.    

One report talks about a woman "whether civilized or savage" (Citation, ID67). Again, these were all common ways to describe women, which shows the little respect that people thought they deserved. They could be talked about essentially in whatever way seemed fitting for the man to describe her.  

Another report from November 15, 1790, says "whether a wife may be cheap or dear at that price time will shew."(CITATION) Analyzing this one line in particular can show a lot about cultural values. First of all, the fact that a wife's value is discussed using words that we use when discussing prices of inanimate objects. It goes to show, that despite the fact that women are humans just as much as men are, the time period that this was written displays different perspectives. We have come a far way since then in terms of what we consider an appropriate way to talk about women, however this example was the way it was for a very long time and it was widely accepted. This was how it was, and it was okay.
