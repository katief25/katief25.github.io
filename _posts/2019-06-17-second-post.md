title: Words of Wisdom

Words are powerful. We tend not to realize just how much we can learn from words, and the ability that they have to portray messages and images about different events. We can understand a lot about the works we are trying to analyze but having the ability to break down words and see the context they are repeatedly being used in. 

I'm sure most of us have heard our parents or teachers tell us to "watch our mouth" when we are young. What's the reason for this? It all comes down to the simple fact that words can be extremely hurtful, but they can also be extremely encouraging. Many of us fail to realize just how important words really are. 

From this word cloud, we are automatically able to see some recurring words that could provide us with themes that came up. We see how United came up a lot but when digging in further, we realize that this is mostly because of discussing the United States and the United Kingdom. It reveals that these countries are involved in the discussion, however much beyond that I realized it wasn't that important. However, a word like society in the cloud, is significantly smaller so at first glance, it would seem like it really wasn't that important and didn't hold much value. But by digging deeper into the word, we are actually able to see how the term was used in society, which often led to information about the society, societal values and other areas of society that could help us to have a better understanding about what the common issues were, what was happening etc.
